          required to retain your information by law or for legitimate business
          purposes, such as to prevent identity theft or other misconduct. For
          inquiries regarding personal information collected or to correct

          We will retain personal information, including user location
          information, only as long as our business needs require. We will then
          destroy or render unreadable any such information upon disposal. We
          believe the security of your information is a serious issue and we are
          committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We use
          commercially reasonable security measures to protect against the loss,
          misuse and alteration of your information under our control. Depending
          on site requirements, we may employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
          encryption technology to transmit data between a consumer’s browser
          and our web server. To use our platform, a consumer will need an
          SSL-capable browser such as MS Internet Explorer 4.0 (or higher) or
          Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher. We require that client network,
          affiliates, and/or vendors handle consumer information under secure
          confidential conditions. Notwithstanding such security measures,
          please be aware that no security measures are perfect or 100% secure,
          and we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to
          or from the Services. Although we have agreements and vetting
          procedures in place for third parties, We are not responsible for the
          actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
          You should note that the security of your personal information also
          depends on you. Please do not communicate any information to us
          through unsecured channels, such as when you are in public areas.
          Where we have provided you or you have chosen a password, access code,
          or similar security feature, you must keep the password, access code
          or security feature confidential. Please do not share your password
          with anyone. If you believe your password or account has been
          compromised, please contact us immediately at info@usasolars.com.
